I attended 2 conferences for 2024 so far (probably that'll be it) -- NARST and AERA. Both are great gatherings in the education field, where I have met lots of great friends and colleagues, and was inspired so much by others. It was a big accomplishment for me to attend such meaningful events, I am proud of myself, and thankful for my advisors and peers who have always been so supportive.
