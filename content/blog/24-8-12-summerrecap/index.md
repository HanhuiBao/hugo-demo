This summer was my third summer in the US, which is crazy. Where did time go? I came to this land in July 2022, starting my master study in a long and hot summer in Maryland. After a year I said goodbye to Maryland and moved to Knoxville in another long and hot summer. After 2 summers all about moving and starting a new life, this summer I finally stayed in the same place and continue to stay in the same life stage.

This summer is, eh, interesting. 2 summer courses, both overwhelming. I'm not gonna lie but one of them really made me question myself, why I'm doing this? It was not challenging, just didn't make sense to me. But I survived, yay! I worked on my research projects too, submitted 2 proposals as the leading author to a conference and a graduate student research grant proposal. Fingers crossed but no matter what the results are, I learned so much along the way. I mean, I still have a long way ahead, no rush. Lots of appreciation to everyone who helped me, from the bottom of my heart. 

Speaking of my personal life, this summer was peaceful and bittersweet. Some of my friends here graduated this summer and either went back to China or moved to another state. After a year of being together a lot, I feel attached to them and sad to see them go. But that's how studying abroad is, you join the community as a new member, and see people come and go every year. Everything is the same and different, I just wish my every friend to stay safe, healthy, and happy. Now there are new friends coming, and they are so great. I can't wait to have fun with my new friends! One good thing was, I spent some time with a close friend (who is still here) playing guitar and singing. Everytime we did it was just so warm, relaxing, just perfect. I had a friend visit me from Pennsylvania, we had a crazy and happy week being home, visiting Nashville and Atalanta.  Friendship between females can always make me feel loved.

I never stop reading, workout, and writing. I love being around with people, but I'm also a person who needs my own space. I benefit from reading and writing forever. I can't afford traveling around the world now, but I can see the world in the book, and all different kind of people and lives, which helps build my own life philosophy and system. Sport is like a healthcare product for me, I'm not a fan but I need it, so I do it. I need dopamine.

Anyways, this summer was not bad except I had 0 travel. I blame my sad wallet. I accomplished something, had some fun, and relaxed. The new semester is about to start, and I'm starting my second year. I'll again, try my best to hit out of my league on my work as this year, while maintaining physical and mental health.
