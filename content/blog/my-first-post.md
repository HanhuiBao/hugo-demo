Recently I'm wrapping up my master's program. I was totally swamped these weeks. Assignments, getting started my PhD program, current projects, and other stuff. Ah, I'm like a working machine jumping between things! But fortunatley, I survived, and I'm much more relaxed right now. Two weeks from now, I will graduate from Johns Hopkins University, and start my new journey as a doctorate student. I can't even imagine!
